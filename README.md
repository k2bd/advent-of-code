# Advent of Code

## Installation

Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) and `poetry install` the project.

## Running

To run a particular puzzle, use `poe solve` with the `--year/-y` and `--day/-d` flags.
For example: `poe solve -y 2020 -d 1`

(Note: if Poetry is managing a virtual environment for you, you may need to use `poetry run poe` instead of just `poe`)
